What's happening here?
------------
Hi, I'm Becca! This github account was originally created for the Johns Hopkins University/Coursera Data Science certificate program. Since completing that, I keep my ongoing and finished projects here.

### I'm currently working on...
* Building a computer from nand gates with [the Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
  * Chapter 9: Writing a game (Tetris!) in the jack language
* Catching up on [AI Safety readings](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) with a study group.
* Revisiting this old [Job Generator](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/JobGenerator) to build a much more sophisticated model. So far I've done...
  * Step 1: create a graph database connecting [Star Wars occupations to organizations and locations](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/WookieeText)
  * Step 2: scrape a [corpora of job descriptions](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/JobScraper)
  * Step 3: train a [transformer model](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/KerasNLPPractice) on the job text

### In general, I'm interested in...
* Language models
* Unconventional data
* Improving my SQL & general data management skills
* Expanding my backend dev toolbox

### Other Projects
#### At the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/):
* üèÜ [Zulip Awards](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/ZulipAwards), a Python script that grabs all the public Zulip messages from a given RC batch, drops them into either a SQL or MongoDB, and generates 'awards' based on users' Zulip usage.
* üéø [Virtual Skiers](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/VirtualSkiers), a little Virtual Recurse Center bot that includes a ski lodge and animated emojis skiing within the virtual space.
#### Other:
* Job post scrapers in [both R](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/ScrapingPractice) and [Python](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/ScraperPython) - why looks at job posts myself when I could write a script to do it for me?
