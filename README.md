What's happening here?
------------
I'm Becca. This github account was originally created for the Johns Hopkins University/Coursera Data Science certificate program, and since that has finished I keep my ongoing and finished projects here.

### I'm currently working on...
* Job Applications
* [Job Description/Wookieepedia Generator](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/JobGenerator) - Using a RNN to generate job posts from a galaxy far, far away!

### In general, I'm interested in...
* Language models
* Scraping web content
* Finding patterns in unconventional/unstructured data
* Improving my SQL & general DB management skills

### Recent Projects
#### At the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/):
* üèÜ [Zulip Awards](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/ZulipAwards), a Python script that grabs all the public Zulip messages from a given RC batch, drops them into either a SQL or MongoDB, and generates 'awards' based on users' Zulip usage.
* üéø [Virtual Skiers](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/VirtualSkiers), a little Virtual Recurse Center bot that includes a ski lodge and animated emojis skiing within the virtual space.
#### Other:
* Job post scrapers in [both R](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/ScrapingPractice) and [Python](https://github.com/MementoMakoMori/ScraperPython) - why looks at job posts myself when I could write a script to do it for me?
